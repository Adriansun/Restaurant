		<comments1> Reviewed on Jan. 10, 2011 by sleepapaul My family and friends have enjoyed this recipe many times. These are a wonderful change frome traditional pancakes and or waffles. Thanks so much for the wonderful tasting recipe.</comments1>
		<comments2> Reviewed on Jun. 10, 2009 by walborg I have not tried this receipe for Swedish Pancakes. Swedish pancakes are NEVER made with oil always melted butter. Since I am Swedish and my parents were born in Swedish and my oldest daughter lives in Sweden I will continue to make my mother's recipe for Swedish pancakes. I wouldn't even want to try this recipe.

		<comments5> Reviewed on Apr. 01, 2009 by dmwenthold I've used a similar recipe that we make a big batch, then freeze. they are great that way too. Another way to serve is with peanut butter, or with butter and brown sugar.</comments5>
		<comments6> Reviewed on Apr. 01, 2009 by dizz3898 answer to your question yes they can be frozen before stuffing put a layer of parchment or waxed paper between each then when ready to use let thaw at room temp they are wonderful this way too</comments6>
		<comments7> Reviewed on Apr. 01, 2009 by jmmurd This is a question, not a comment. Can these be frozen? How are they after they are frozen?</comments7>
		<comments8> Reviewed on Apr. 01, 2009 by Bniccolls Mix/whip cream cheese and butter or margarine together and spread on pancakes. Then add a dollup of cherry, apple, or blackberry pie filling and roll up like a blitz or do the fold over thing. Sprinkle rollup with powder sugar. Place side by side in rows on serving platter for a beautiful addition to a tasty brunch.</comments8>
